#  Sovereign-Ops: Autonomous Cloud Operations Engine

---

## 🧠 Overview

Sovereign-Ops is a hands-on DevOps/AIOps project focused on building a self-managing cloud environment on AWS.

The motivation behind this project was to address a common gap in modern cloud systems: most scaling and monitoring workflows are still reactive and depend heavily on manual intervention. This project explores how a system can observe metrics, make decisions, and take action automatically.

It combines infrastructure automation with a lightweight decision engine to simulate autonomous cloud operations in a practical environment.

---

## Problem Statement

In typical cloud environments:

- Scaling is triggered only after load increases  
- Monitoring requires manual interpretation of dashboards  
- Tooling is often fragmented across IaC, CI/CD, and observability  

This results in:

- Delayed response to traffic spikes  
- Increased operational overhead  
- Risk of performance degradation under peak load  

---

## ⚙️ Approach

Instead of treating each layer independently, this project integrates multiple DevOps practices into a unified system:

- Terraform for reproducible infrastructure  
- Ansible for consistent server configuration  
- K3s (Kubernetes) for container orchestration  
- Prometheus and Grafana for observability  
- A Python-based decision engine for automated scaling  

The system is designed around a closed feedback loop:

Metrics → Decision → Action

---

## ▫️ Architecture Overview

The system is structured in layered components:

### Provisioning Layer
Terraform provisions AWS infrastructure including VPC, EC2 instances, networking, and security configurations.

### Configuration Layer
Ansible automates server setup, installs Docker and K3s, and applies system-level configurations.

### Orchestration Layer
K3s manages containerized workloads, deployments, and services.

### CI/CD Layer
Jenkins pipelines automate build, test, and deployment workflows.

### Observability Layer
Prometheus collects system and application metrics, while Grafana provides visualization and dashboards.

### Decision Layer
A Python-based engine periodically queries Prometheus and triggers scaling actions using Kubernetes commands (`kubectl`).

## 👾 Autonomous Scaling Logic

The decision engine operates as a control loop:

- Fetches CPU and traffic-related metrics from Prometheus  
- Applies threshold-based logic to evaluate system state  
- Triggers scaling actions on Kubernetes deployments  

This approach is intentionally lightweight and rule-based. While it does not use machine learning, it demonstrates how intelligent behavior can be introduced into DevOps pipelines.

## 🗯️ Key Outcomes

- Reduced dependency on manual scaling decisions  
- End-to-end automated infrastructure lifecycle  
- Improved observability and system visibility  
- Practical demonstration of DevOps combined with AIOps concepts  

---

## ✨ Limitations and Future Improvements

Current limitations:

- Decision logic is threshold-based (no predictive model)  
- Runs on a single-node K3s cluster (no high availability)  
- Scaling actions are basic and can be extended  

Potential improvements:

- Predictive scaling using historical metrics  
- Multi-node Kubernetes cluster with high availability  
- Event-driven architecture instead of polling-based logic  

---

## 💡 Motivation

This project was built to move beyond basic tool usage and focus on system-level thinking:

- Understanding how different layers of DevOps interact  
- Exploring how automation evolves into decision-making systems  
- Reducing human dependency in operational workflows
